## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the AI Labs repository, clone the repository and explore the available algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented with flexibility and scalability in mind.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-labs.git
```

## 💡 Implemented Algorithms
### 🧩 Sudoku Solver
Our Sudoku solver uses genetic algorithms to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles efficiently. The implementation focuses on optimizing the solution's accuracy and speed.

### 📦 Bin Packing
The bin packing algorithm aims to efficiently pack objects of different volumes into a finite number of bins with minimal space wastage. This is particularly useful for logistics and resource management.

### 📝 Hello-World String
This classic problem involves evolving a population of strings towards a target string ("Hello, World!") using genetic algorithms. It's a great way to demonstrate the basic principles of genetic algorithms.

## 🛠️ Usage
To use any of the implemented algorithms, follow the instructions in the respective folders. Each folder contains a README file with detailed usage instructions and examples.
